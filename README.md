# Password-Generator

## What: 
  The objective was to create a random password generator where the user is able to select what type of variables they want to use in their password, as well as the password length. The user can also copy the password by selecting Copy to Password.

## Why:
    this activity heavily utilized the use of functions, which are commonly used in day to day coding and are importany to master. 

## How:
    I used bootstrap to get the basic layout for the generator and then from there used css and added some html to customize it to look like the prompt. Adding Javascript to the code was what made it interacgtive and user friendly. 

## Features:
    My page features two main buttons that when clicked, invoke a specific function. When you click the generate password button, the site prompts the user to make decisions on the structure of your password, and when you click the copy to clickboard button, the password is copied. 

## Difficulties:
    The hardest part of this activity was linking all of the answers to the prompts/confirms to create the password. This type of coding does not come naturally to me yet so it was very difficult.
